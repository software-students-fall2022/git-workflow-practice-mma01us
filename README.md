#### Here's a Quick Summary:

Ken Rimple, a software engineer at Chariot Solutions, recalls how software engineering has changed in 20 years. In 2002, proprietary software (ex: database software like Microsoft SQL Server, application servers, and version control) dominated the scene. There was no Stack Overflow so developers had to read a lot of books and manuals. Compared to 20 years ago, open source is now widely used, automation makes building, testing, and deploying easier, mobile applications now exist, and a much wider selection of languages, frameworks, and platforms are available. 

### What's Interesting?

As students entering the field of Software Engineering, we might not consider its history to be important. It's interesting to think what we *might* be learning to become a Software Engineer 20 years ago. Smartphones and mobile applications are widely used in our day to day life and they did not even exist 20 years ago. The invention of the smartphone led to the entire field of mobile development and the creation of many new languages and frameworks. Alternatives to proprietary software have made it easier for new developers and students to work on personal projects without having to pay ridiculous fees for software licensing. For example, while working on a personal website, instead of needing a server and licenses to host a database, we can use a free online alternative (although there may be limits to database size, and access). While studying the past 20 years of change, it's exciting to consider what Software Engineering might look like 20 years from now. How much will automation take over? Will there be a new invention like the smartphone? What will the most prominent programming languages, frameworks, and platforms look like? What predictions do you have for the next 20 years of Software Engineering?
